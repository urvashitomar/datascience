Flatten Lists
Description
Given a list structure x, unlist produces a vector which contains all the atomic components which occur in x.

Usage
unlist(x, recursive = TRUE, use.names = TRUE)
Arguments
x	A list.
recursive	logical. Should unlisting be applied to list components of x?
use.names	logical. Should names be preserved?
Details
If recursive=FALSE, the function will not recurse beyond the first level items in x.

By default, unlist tries to retain the naming information present in x. If use.names = FALSE all naming information is dropped.

See Also
c, as.list.

Examples
unlist(options())
unlist(unlist(options(), use.names=F))# works for vectors or lists
l.ex <- list(a = list(1:5, LETTERS[1:5]), b = "Z", c = NA)
unlist(l.ex, rec = F)
unlist(l.ex, rec = T)
